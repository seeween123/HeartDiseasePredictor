# Installation

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seeween123/HeartDiseasePredictor.git

cd HeartDiseasePredictor
```

---

## Create Virtual Environment
### Environment Setup

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

### Windows

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
Python3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

> **Note:** Ensure that `uv` is installed before running the last command. If not, install it using:
>
> ```powershell
> pip install uv
> ```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running the Project

Run the complete pipeline

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

or

```bash
python src/main.py
```

---

# Running the API

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Open

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

to access the interactive Swagger UI.

---

# Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA notebook performs:

- Missing value analysis
- Duplicate detection
- Data validation
- Statistical summaries
- Distribution analysis
- Boxplots
- Correlation heatmap
- Multicollinearity analysis (VIF)
- Feature importance exploration

Outputs generated include:

- Histograms
- Boxplots
- Correlation Matrix
- VIF Report
- Data Summary

---

# Feature Engineering

The preprocessing pipeline includes:

- Missing value handling
- One-hot encoding
- Feature scaling
- Train/Test split
- Feature selection
- Processed dataset generation

---

# Machine Learning Models

The following algorithms were evaluated:

- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

Model performance was evaluated using:

- Recall
- F1 Score
- Accuracy
- Precision
- ROC-AUC

For this medical classification problem, Recall was prioritized to reduce false negatives.

---

# Hyperparameter Optimization

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **Optuna**.

Optuna employs Bayesian optimization using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampler to efficiently search for optimal model parameters.

Parameters optimized include:

### XGBoost

- learning_rate
- max_depth
- n_estimators
- min_child_weight
- gamma
- subsample
- colsample_bytree
- reg_alpha
- reg_lambda

Benefits of Optuna:

- Faster than Grid Search
- Bayesian optimization
- Automatic pruning of poor trials
- Reduced computation time
- Better model performance

---

# MLflow Experiment Tracking

MLflow is used to record every experiment.

Each run stores:

- Hyperparameters
- Metrics
- Artifacts
- Trained models
- Feature importance
- Configuration files
- Evaluation reports

The best model is registered in the MLflow Model Registry before deployment.

---

# Model Deployment

The selected production model is exported into the serving directory.

FastAPI loads the production model and exposes REST endpoints for prediction.

# Docker

Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t heart-disease-predictor .
```

Run container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 heart-disease-predictor
```

---

# Container Orchestration

This project uses Minikube for creating a virtual cluster and orchestrate the docker contatiner. Deployment.yaml and Service.yaml are used
for Minikube configuration. Stantard commands are used to load/unload the container+pod on the target vitual nodes. 


# CI/CD

GitHub Actions automates the following tasks:

- Checkout repository
- Install dependencies
- Lint source code. Use ruff to find and fix code issues.
- Execute unit tests
- Build Docker image
- Validate application

The pipeline executes automatically for:

- Push to `main`
- Pull Requests
