INFERENCE PIPELINE - Production ML Model Serving with Feature Consistency
=========================================================================

This module provides the core inference functionality for the Heart Disease prediction model.
It ensures that serving-time feature transformations exactly match training-time transformations,
which is CRITICAL for model accuracy in production.

Key Responsibilities:
1. Load MLflow-logged model and feature metadata from training
2. Apply identical feature transformations as used during training
3. Ensure correct feature ordering for model input
4. Convert model predictions to user-friendly output

CRITICAL PATTERN: Training/Serving Consistency
- Uses fixed BINARY_MAP for deterministic binary encoding
- Applies same one-hot encoding with drop_first=True
- Maintains exact feature column order from training
- Handles missing/new categorical values gracefully

Production Deployment:
- MODEL_DIR points to containerized model artifacts
- Feature schema loaded from training-time artifacts
- Optimized for single-row inference (real-time serving)

    Main prediction function for Heart Disease inference.
    
    This function provides the complete inference pipeline from raw patient data
    to business-friendly prediction output. It's called by both the FastAPI endpoint
    and the Gradio interface to ensure consistent predictions.
    
    Pipeline:
    1. Convert input dictionary to DataFrame
    2. Apply feature transformations (identical to training)
    3. Generate model prediction using loaded XGBoost model
    4. Convert prediction to user-friendly string
